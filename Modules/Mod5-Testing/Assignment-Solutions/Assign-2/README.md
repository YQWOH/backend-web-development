# Assignment #2 - Write Integration test for ShopApp

Make sure to get 100% test coverage, after running the command `npm test`

You will have to write integrations tests for:

* All your methods in the services
  * Make sure to have a connection to a test database, where it's actually retrieving valid data.
* All the methods in the controllers
  * Create Mock methods for your service calls under the controller methods

Try to get as close as possible to 100% test coverage. If you are unable test a certain file or files, please state which file you aren't able to test in the Github Issue you will create for the submission of this assignment.

## Running the tests

First to install the necessary packages
`npm install`

To run all the test cases
