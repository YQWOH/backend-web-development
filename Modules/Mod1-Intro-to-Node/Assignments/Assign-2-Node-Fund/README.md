# Assignment #2 ~ JavaScript FUNdamentals

You will be extending some functions based on what we did in our code along sessions.

## Insertion sort algorithm

Use the pseudocode and translate it JS code
<https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/insertion_sort_algorithm.htm>

## Prime number detector

If the number is not a prime number, get the next highest prime number, and the previous lower prime number.

## Function to reverse a list

The function should read a list and the size of the list.
Prints out the list in the reverse order.

## Function to read a list and perform certain actions (Unlucky Looping)

If there's a prime number

* Add a 4 to the end of the list.

If there's an odd number

* Skip the next adjacent item in the list.

If there's an 13

* Print "Unlucky", and end the loop.
