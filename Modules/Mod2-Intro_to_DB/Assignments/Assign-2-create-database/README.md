# Assignment #2 - Creating ShopApp database

For this assignment, you guys will be creating a MySQL database based on the ERD you created for Assignment #1.

You'll be updating the initialize_scripts.sql file located here <https://github.com/joinsigma/backend-web-development/blob/main/Modules/Mod2-Intro_to_DB/Assignments/Assign-2-create-database/initialize_tables.sql>

Make sure to include:

* CREATE TABLE scripts
* ALTER TABLE scripts, to update the foreign key constraints
* DROP TABLE scripts, leave these commented out.
* INSERT scripts for some mock data.
* SELECT scripts for these following queries
  * Get all the Products that are “Out of Stock”
  * Get all Payments that have the status “payment_failed”
  * Get all Products with their respective Product descriptions
  * Get all Users that have bought products
  * Get the number of Products bought per User
  * Get the amount sold per Product
  * Get the number of Products per Store
  * Get the number of unique Products bought by User
