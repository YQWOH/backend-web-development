For this assignment, you'll be creating an ERD diagram for the following case study:

## Case Study

I would like to create a website to allow users to sell unique products to buyers. I want to connect buyers directly to sellers within the website. There will be 2  types of users, a Seller and Buyer. Each user will just have their name, email, and the type of user they are.

Each seller will have their own store, the store will have a name, physical location (if they have one). Each store, will have products that it sells, each product will have a name and a description, price, the quantity they have in stock, and the what category the product belongs to.

A buyer will be able to order any product from any store, each order will have a delivery date, an order status (whether it's been delivered, shipped, and completed), total price for the entire order, and what product they bought, and the quantity of each product bought. Also for each order, a buyer is able to leave a review and a rating for each product they bought.

Additionally, for every order, I need to keep the payment information, I need the amount that the buyer paid, payment mode they used, and the status of the payment as well.

_NOTE: Your tables may **vary** from **mine**, and even your fellow peers. Ideally, I'd like to see at least 6 tables._
